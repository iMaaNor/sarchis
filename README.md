# sArchis 0.9 Beta
## Simple Arch Installer Script
**sArchis** is a simple script for installing arch linux in a very simple way with help of whiptail!  
I tried to make installing arch easier for everyone.  
But highly recommended that install arch with official archlinux guide and by yourself!   
   
## Usage
1) Download an iso from archlinux site 
2) Make a bootable usb with arch iso 
3) Boot to live archlinux 
4) Install git package 
```sh
pacman -Sy git 
```
5) Clone this repository 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/iMaaNor/sarchis 
```
6) Enter to sarchis folder 
```sh
cd sarchis 
```
7) Run sarchis 
```sh
bash sarchis.sh 
```
